# BinBuddy
For eco-friendly businesses who either want to make profit from their recyclable waste or want to buy cheap reusable materials and promote circular economy, the BinBuddy is a B2B application that connects these two parties. Unlike companies that sell recycled materials, this app maximizes the benefits for both businesses by conveniently organizing all the logistics to keep the process as simple as possible and allowing companies to focus on their core-objectives.
